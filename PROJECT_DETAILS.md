# Fake News Detection using Python

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a reliable system that accurately distinguishes between real and fake news articles using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

## Problem Statement
The challenge is to create an automated system to identify fake news, which is currently a major issue due to the slow and resource-intensive nature of manual fact-checking.

## Abstract
With the rise of social media, fake news has become a major concern, leading to social conflicts and misinformation. This project uses a dataset of real and fake news to analyze accuracy and precision using Python, visualizing results in graphs.

## Requirements

### Hardware
- **CPU**: Dual-core processor or higher
- **RAM**: 8GB or more
- **Storage**: Enough space for dataset and additional software

### Software
- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux
- **Python**: Version 3.7 or higher
- **IDE**: Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

## Methodology
The project involves the following steps:
1. **Data Collection**: Collect news data from Twitter Streaming API and store it in a structured format.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data for analysis, including text preprocessing and feature extraction.
3. **Classification**: Classify the news as real or fake using sentiment scores and NLP techniques.
4. **Analysis**: Evaluate and visualize the accuracy and performance of the model.

## Design

### Architecture
The system architecture includes data collection, preprocessing, model deployment, and real-time prediction modules.

### Flow Chart


## Project Modules
1. **Data Collection Module**: Aggregates data from various sources and stores raw data.
2. **Data Preprocessing Module**: Cleans and converts text data to numerical vectors using techniques like TF-IDF.
3. **Model Deployment Module**: Provides an interface for users to interact with the model (e.g., command-line or web app).

## Source Code


## Testing
Testing ensures the functionality and reliability of the system. This project includes:
- **Manual Testing**: Verification of model predictions.
- **Automated Testing**: Ensures consistent results.

## Screenshots of Output


## Future Scope
1. **Enhanced Accuracy**: Incorporate advanced algorithms like transformers (BERT, GPT-4) and neural networks.
2. **Multilingual Capabilities**: Extend support for multiple languages and cross-cultural applications.
3. **Real-Time Processing**: Improve scalability for real-time predictions using cloud computing.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of Python and machine learning in developing a fake news detection model, providing valuable insights into Python programming, NLP, and machine learning. The skills gained here are foundational for future projects.
