## About

The goal of this project is to reduce the spread of misleading news by classifying articles as either ***Fake*** or ***Real.*** A dataset containing labeled news headlines and content was used to train a machine learning model. The text data is preprocessed using NLTK, converted into numerical format using TF-IDF, and then passed into a Logistic Regression model for prediction.

The final model performs well and gives accuracy score on the test data.

## Future Work

- Add a user-friendly web interface.
- Explore advanced models like LSTM or BERT for better performance.
- Support classification in multiple languages.
- Optimize the model for faster predictions.

---

## Features

- Detects fake news based on content.
- Preprocesses text using standard NLP techniques.
- Uses TF-IDF vectorizer and Logistic Regression model.
- Displays accuracy and confusion matrix for evaluation.
